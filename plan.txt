For the AI game, the AI will have 

2 outputs: rotational velocity, and the ability to shoot.

2 Inputs: current rotation, and the angle of nearest enemy.

this is a pretty simple concept, the AI will simply have to orient itself to the enemy, and shoot when aligned.
If it ends up working some, some simple ways to make it cooler are:
    - making it only have control over the rotational acceleration, and give it access to rotation and rotational velocity.
    - adding more than 1 type of obstical. For example, a bomb that explodes when shot, but dissapears when close.
    - giving it access to more than one enemy at a time
    - more complex movement for enemies
    - punishing it for shooting too much, making it conserve ammo.
    - adding traits to enemies (like speed, so it has to manage the faster ones sooner than the slow ones)
